# 5. Tags

Now that we've looked at backlinks, let's dive into tags.

Tags are a very useful way of grouping multiple notes so they are easy to find.

A tag is essentially a clickable search through your entire Vault for a term. Think of them like hashtags.

For example, clicking on #tags will bring up a search with all notes that contain that tag. 

Most people use them for broad categories of things

	- #computer-science, #philosophy 
- or the status of something
	- #draft, #completed
